# COMP2001_SW

This is the code repository for the Linked Data PHP application created for COMP2001 Coursework 2.

The hosted implementation can be found [here](http://web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/shirley/).

The application takes the [Wildflower Meadows dataset](https://plymouth.thedata.place/dataset/plymouth-wildflower-meadows) provided by Plymouth City Council and adds mapping to aid understanding of the data.  This can be viewed [here](http://web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/shirley/public/data.php)

An RDF output for the dataset is also provided [here](http://web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/shirley/meadows)
